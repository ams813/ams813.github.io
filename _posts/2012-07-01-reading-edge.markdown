short-description:   "This microsite introduces Font Bureau’s Reading Edge™ (RE) series, a first-of-its-kind group of typefaces designed from scratch to serve highly readable small text on screen. The site aims to impart a deeper understanding of the anatomy of readable type while directing users to purchase the fonts."

Today’s screens impose many restrictions on web typography. Web designers, developers, and publishers continue to rely on web-safe defaults like Arial or Georgia for small text, because before this series, there weren’t many other options that didn’t compromise readability. Font Bureau sought to alleviate this tension between the screen and legible, refined typography by proving to users that the RE typefaces would help them celebrate fine print.

The RE site needed to balance educating users with conversion points—directing them to purchase the faces (and their larger-sized accompaniments) from Font Bureau’s Webtype catalog. Stylistically, the site needed to align with Font Bureau’s brand, standing in harmony with a series of other [typographic](http://georgiaverdana.com/) [microsites](http://www.fontbureau.com/nhg/) the company had launched. Most of all, small type had to be the hero.

  <figcaption class="caption">With few assets other than the faces themselves, I jumped straight into sketching content ideas in the context of layout. Within our condensed timeline, we decided to keep the site constrained to a single page to feature controlled, art-directed outcomes and beautifully set type.</figcaption>

Typeset with RE typefaces, the essay also demonstrates the typographic control users can expect from the series.</figcaption>
