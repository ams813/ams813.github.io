short-description:   "Iron Chef Jose Garces’ restaurant group was determined to focus more attention on its event planning division. Garces Events needed a refreshed aesthetic and user experience that would increase inquiries, appeal to both planners and social customers, and cross-sell catering services with restaurant private events."

Leading chef and restaurateur Jose Garces’ thriving event planning division was outgrowing its website—a single destination that also presented content for his restaurants, 40-acre farm, and generous foundation. Garces Events needed a home to promote its unparalleled hospitality, personalized menus, and venues and to host all life’s celebrations.

Set on a compact timeline, we relied a collaborative workshop to establish site architecture and requirements early on. We developed HTML wireframes to document content hierarchy and functionality for our six site templates, then evolved the Garces Group brand aesthetic to define a sub-brand unique to Garces Events.

Like a chef builds depth of flavor, the new identity relies on subtle layering and a palette of neutral, warm colors. We revised the logotype for consistency with the larger brand and introduced a narrowed set of brand typefaces that are sophisticated yet easy to read on the web.
