short-description:   "David’s Bridal had recently replatformed and responsified its website, but its user experience faltered and the design already felt outdated to new branding. To be seen as a world-class authority in wedding attire, David’s needed to reset perceptions and present a website that went beyond pushing product."

With over 300 stores in North America and more than 60 years of experience dressing women, David’s Bridal is a household name for affordable, accessible fashion. Nearly one in three U.S. brides walks down the aisle wearing David’s Bridal, and millions—whether end-customers or not—begin their search for a dress online. Despite having a well-trafficked website, David’s Bridal was eager to replace its clunky experience with one that would connect emotionally with users.

Buying a wedding dress isn’t a straightforward transaction. David’s needed a website that would inspire, educate, and empower brides in the process of finding “the one.” David’s also wanted to elevate its other business units—like Bridesmaid, Mother of the Bride, and Prom—so that women of all ages could see David’s as a shopping destination for their special occasion.

We set out to simulate the ultimate in-store sales associate and meet users where they are in the planning/shopping process—the majority being first-time visitors, or just browsing. We’d seamlessly guide users through all David’s has to offer and educate them so they’d feel empowered to make their own selections.

With the urgency to fix issues on the live site, we prioritized pages by user flow—product exploration, account management, checkout, store locations, appointments, etc. Wireframes served as testable prototypes and provided implementation guidance, while our polished comps and InVision flows illustrated the workings of our design system. Our work culminated with a library of coded patterns spanning an entire e-commerce experience.

  <figcaption class="caption">David’s redesigned homepage rests on a framework that speaks to prioritized audiences based on the season. Each section directs users to filtered product listings based on current trends, blog posts, and planning tips. By presenting product through the lens of branded content, we would position David’s as a style expert and give users multiple ways in depending on their readiness to purchase.</figcaption>

  <figcaption class="caption">New audience-based landing pages are intent on pacing the shopping experience—to first inspire and educate, and then guide to options. Much like the in-store experience, the bride landing page starts with asking brides about their vision for their wedding day and educating on silhouettes as a means to direct to dresses.</figcaption>

  <figcaption class="caption">Detail pages highlight new product photography and David's unique breadth of colors and sizes. Our typographic system weaves in David's brand voice, but otherwise remains utilitarian to account for a complex sea of metadata. Real bride photos and product recommendations help users envision their completed look.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>Our team defined, designed, and user-tested new functionality that—much like a wedding registry—would enable brides to set color and/or style options for their bridesmaid dresses. Using this same tool, bridesmaids could select and order their dresses in the right size, and David’s would keep the bride updated as purchases were made. As a deliverable to aid David’s implementation, we annotated our designs through various user flows that the site would need to accommodate.</figcaption>
