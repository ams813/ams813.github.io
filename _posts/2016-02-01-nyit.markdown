short-description:   "With its students graduating to become engineers, physicians, architects, and designers, NYIT wanted a new website that matched the energy and innovation embedded in its campuses. My design concept was selected and applied across the site’s 13 templates for the upcoming redesign."
role:   Creative direction, design concept

NYIT is a global, dynamic, and forward-thinking university with five (soon to be six) campuses and seven schools/colleges. Its students graduate profession-ready and become engaged physicians, scientists, architects, engineers, and more. While technology and innovation underscore everything it does, NYIT’s website wasn’t showing it. Through this redesign, NYIT wanted to build its reputation, instill trust in potential applicants, and embrace its newly revised brand guidelines.

<p class="caption">My selected design concept adopted the logo’s square and use of Times New Roman in creative ways. Research assets and photography took the spotlight, and different planes intersected and layered to simulate the energy of ideas. Illustrations, the addition of a monospaced font, and touches of animation kept the approach youthful.</p>

<p class="caption">We designed for small screens at the same time as large to help focus on readability and content priority. The feature area served as a way to quickly change the tone of the page.</p>
