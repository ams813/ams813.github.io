Throughout seven seasons of the TV series *The West Wing*, we hear President Jed Bartlet [repeatedly ask his White House staff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSUHgAp7V7c), “What's next?”

Bartlet explains his catchphrase’s intent in the second episode of season two, during a flashback to the campaign trail. Bartlet and his team are discussing strategies for securing his nomination for the presidency. When a character belabors a proposal, Bartlet counters: **“I understood the point.... When I ask ‘What's next?’ it means I'm ready to move on to other things. So, what's next?”**

Functionally, the phrase signals to viewers the closing of one chapter and the pursuit of a new storyline, but philosophically, his question always comes to mind when I think about productivity.

Productivity is a simple calculation: the rate at which an item is produced or a goal is achieved; maximizing the volume of work output in a period of time. But, by not typically performing exclusively rote tasks, our ability to do the mental math on our own productivity is limited. Productivity for most is a state of mind—one that’s sensitive to factors like the complexity of a task or pain-in-the-butt-ness of a particular to-do.

I don’t think that the *feeling* of productivity is really about output at all. If one can feel productive while checking off only a few small items from a list, maybe productivity really lives in the spaces *between* tasks. Productivity, as Bartlet hints, may be more so about a readiness to move on than a measure of completion.

But in trying to feel productive, we place ourselves in a constant battle between maintaining dedicated focus and trying to minimize attuning to “what’s next.” We let the next task bleed into our current mind-space for the sake of building momentum. When we concentrate so heavily on what’s next, we might just miss what’s now.
