short-description:   "While NRT is the largest residential real estate brokerage in the nation, its franchised Coldwell Banker online presence was spread across 17 regional desktop websites. Losing competition to aggregator websites and other brokerages, NRT wanted to focus its resources, traffic, SEO, and local content into a single website with a superior property search."

National Realty Trust (NRT), the largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage, operated a network of 17 separate brokerage websites for its regional Coldwell Banker companies. While known for its trusted agents and extensive footprint in metropolitan areas, NRT’s property-search experience had fallen short to large online aggregators and other brokerages.

In order to better serve its users and agents, unify the presentation of its brand, and ensure better extensibility and governance, NRT ambitiously aimed to consolidate its separate websites into a single, responsive destination and best-of-breed experience in online home-buying.

We set out to build a web-app experience that would serve both agents and homebuyers, by providing the quickest and easiest path to relevant results. While HTML-prototyping and designing and coding over 20 templates, we worked closely with home-buyers, agents, and the NRT Web Services team to ensure the new experience felt intuitive, accounted for all property data scenarios, and could be implemented into a custom back-end.

Background photography and page content were tailored to the user’s regional zone. A modernized color palette brought Coldwell Banker into the 21st century.</figcaption>

  <figcaption class="caption">After conducting a competitive analysis and testing with users, we landed on a search results experience that truly synced the property list with a map, so that as you navigated one, the other adapted. On larger screens, users wouldn’t have to choose between property specifics and relative proximity, and could filter properties easily without leaving results. We chose the Whitney type family as a new brand typeface for its friendliness, onscreen legibility, and its clarity in densely packed metadata.</figcaption>
