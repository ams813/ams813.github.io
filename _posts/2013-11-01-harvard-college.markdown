short-description:   "Operating multiple websites, Harvard College had created a confusing, fragmented, and duplicative digital experience. To break down internal silos, the undergraduate school needed a single, student-centered destination that put content first."

Harvard College, the undergraduate arm of Harvard University, had been historically decentralized. By operating separate websites to represent itself and its offices of Admissions and Financial Aid, users were forced to move between multiple sites to find what they were looking for. While the College didn’t need to increase its application volume, it did feel like a poor web experience had played a role in its losing accepted students to other top-tier schools.

The College needed a single, responsive website that would serve as a central point for the Harvard undergraduate experience, one more consistent with the affordable, vibrant, and academically and culturally diverse life on campus.

With this responsive redesign, we set out to turn talented, diverse prospects into confident applicants—and successful Harvard students—with content that made Harvard feel within reach, created a sense of belonging, and clarified the path from application to graduation. Along the way, we equipped and empowered the Harvard team to improve and maintain their own content.

Working with a strict palette of Arial and Georgia challenged us to inject life into two frequently-used, neutral-voiced fonts.</figcaption>
