short-description:   With years of grants, events, and research under its belt, the Institute for New Economic Thinking had outgrown both its website architecture and its CMS. To justify itself to donors and the academic community, the Institute needed a new website that could connect its disparate content to prove and amplify its work.

The Institute for New Economic Thinking, a nonpartisan research and education nonprofit, was created in response to the global financial crisis of 2007-08 to broaden how we think about, apply, and learn about the field of economics. In the years since its founding, the Institute has funded research, held events, and fostered a place to contribute new thinking in the field. But with a globally focused mission and no proper mobile support, its previous website was not keeping pace. 

The Institute needed a responsive website that would showcase its seven years of work, and make that work accessible to audiences across expertise levels. Our goal was to establish the Institute as the go-to source for new perspectives on economic issues.

The new site structure made clear what the Institute is, the educational materials it offers, and the topical breadth it covers. From the site structure, I derived a list of templates for us to design and code.

Caption: Resetting expectations called for a brand refresh. The design system was a hat tip to the Institute's independent rhythm and scholarly roots. A clean, predominantly warm and neutral palette strayed from beloved blues of think tanks and research nonprofits. Dense levels of text and thick rules kept elements well-structured.

Across the site, we relied on black-and-white photography to keep a unified, editorial look. Color photos were incorporated selectively to highlight features and video content.

By elevating subject-matter experts and closely connecting individuals to their research, the website could become the go-to place for finding a comprehensive selection of a person’s papers and perspectives.

A taxonomy of topics—big-picture, broad economics concepts that described an area of the Institute’s focus—threaded through the site’s content, but were also given spaces to frame work and add context.
