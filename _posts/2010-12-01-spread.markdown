<em>Spread</em>, a hypothetical magazine, is a smorgasbord of food and design. The magazine serves up food-related design inspiration from commercial to environmental realms while showing how design choices affect perceptions of food—what we buy and where we eat. For <em>Spread</em>’s (partial) pilot issue, I designed a cover, table of contents, two features, and eight departments—each comprising placeholder content and imagery for the purpose of the assignment.
